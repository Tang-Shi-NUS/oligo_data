    <sequence> field has priority over <reverse complement> or <identical> field.
    <identical> field is not used in this design, but it functions similarly to
    <reverse complement> field in that it points to another sub-sequence (except, in
    the case of <identical>, it points to a sequence to copy whole-sale, not take the
    reverse compelement of).


oligos:  # do not modify this line

  # oligos can have boring names (e.g. 'A', 'B') or more descriptive names (e.g. 'target-binding', 'ab-conjugate')
  #  - the only requirement is that they are UNIQUE
  A:
    # <description> field for oligos is optional and free for all
    description: target-binding oligo (probe)
    # keys at this level must be 0, 3, or 5 to indicate whether the sub-sequences contained are
    #  on the 3' (3) or 5' (5) side of the main sequence (0)
    0:
      # keys at this level describe the distance of a sub-sequence from main (0), and must be numerical
      #  - pole = 0 should only have ONE sub-sequence enty at this level, which is 0
      0:
        # <sequence> field is REQUIRED and accepts only valid ATGC/atgc strings or '<>' or '<<>>'
        #  - <>: required sequence, must be filled in before calling OligoBuilder.build_oligos()
        sequence: <>
        # <description> field for sub-sequences is optional and free-for-all, same as the

        #  manual conversion/sequence entry.
        #  - a sub-sequence ID is always in the following format:

        # as referring to a sub-sequence by its ID is risky as the ID may change due to
        #  rearrangements of sequences to build new designs, using an alias simplifies matters
        #  - aliases are more readable 'ID's associated with a sequence so referring to a
        #     sub-sequence by its descriptive alias is more intuitive
        #  - aliases are also more stable as they are associated directly with a sub-sequence
        #     and not its position relative to main (X_0_0)
